# Vehicle Booking System 👇 (Reactjs, Nodejs, Sequelize)

    Node.js with Express.js: Server-side framework for building the API endpoints.
    Sequelize: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with the SQL database.

## Frontend Architecture

    Material UI: Component library for React to style and structure the UI.
    Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for additional styling.
